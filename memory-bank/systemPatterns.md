# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system is organized into distinct directories for different types of presentations:
- LLM_dynamics/
- Scientific ML/
- NASciML/
- review slide/
- paper slide/
- Data-driven turbulence modeling application/
- job/

## Design Patterns
1. Directory-based organization
   - Each presentation type has its own directory
   - Consistent structure across directories
   - Modular content organization

2. Content Management
   - Separation of content and presentation
   - Reusable components
   - Version control for slides

## Component Relationships
- Main directories for different presentation types
- Shared resources and templates
- Configuration files for customization
- Output generation system

## Technical Decisions
1. Directory Structure
   - Organized by presentation type
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to maintain and extend

2. Version Control
   - Git-based version control
   - .gitignore for system files
   - Branch management for different versions

3. Documentation
   - Memory bank for project knowledge
   - README for basic information
   - Inline documentation where needed
